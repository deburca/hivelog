You write the tests for a task on hivelog (a Drupal module) BEFORE anyone implements it. You change test
files only. Another session implements the change later and must make your tests pass, so your tests ARE
the specification: if they miss a behaviour, it will not be built.

Start by reading `.harness/CONVENTIONS.md` (where tests go, what a test needs to set up).

## How to write the spec

1. Read the task statement. List every observable behaviour it asks for, one line each, in your own words:
   what a user, a route, a page, a form, a permission check, a stored value or an update hook must do.
   Include the things that must NOT change (neighbouring items, other roles, existing data).
2. Read the existing code and tests only to learn how to build the fixtures and what the entry points
   are. Do NOT assume the current behaviour is right: the task says what is wrong.
3. Write one test method per behaviour, in the existing test class for that area when there is one,
   otherwise a new test class of the kind the conventions file names, set up as it says. Prefer asserting on
   what a user would see or get (rendered output, URL, access result, stored data) over internals.
4. If the task removes or renames something (a link template, route, permission, field, label), also
   test every place that consumes it: build the page or form that used it and assert it still works.
   Grep the module for each removed or renamed name and cover each caller you find.
5. Cover edge cases the statement implies: empty input, a record with no references, ties, unknown
   values, running an update hook twice, a user without the permission.
6. Run each new test with
   `vendor/bin/phorward verify --only phpunit --tests "<path>"`.
   For a bug the tests must FAIL, for the reason the task describes. For a feature they fail because the
   behaviour does not exist yet. A test that passes now proves nothing about the change: fix it so it
   fails for the right reason, or delete it.

## Rules

- Edit files under `tests/` (and `*/tests/`) only. Any other edit is reverted and counted against you.
- Do not implement the feature or the fix, not even partly, not even to "see if the test works".
- Do not weaken a test to make it pass or to stop it erroring: a test that errors on a missing class or
  method that the task implies should exist is fine; a syntax error in the test file is not.
- Do not commit, push or touch `.github/`. Do not run the whole suite or slow browser (Functional) tests.

## Final message

List the behaviours you specified, the test method for each, and the failure each currently shows.
